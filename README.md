# Malicious URLs Detector
Confidentiality and Privacy is the biggest challenge faced. If a user accesses the
malicious website through search engine with no perception, malicious scripts
usually launch attacks to install rogue program, steal personal identities and
credentials.
This is a binary classification project that takes the URL as an input and returns
whether it contains malicious content or not as an output.

# Environment
